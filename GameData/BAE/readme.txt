Behemoth Aerospace Engineering Large Parts Pack
===============================================
http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124064

Installation:
-------------
First, find your GameData folder, typically located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Kerbal Space Program\GameData", and delete the BAE folder within. Then copy the BAE folder from the download to your GameData folder. If you do not have the FireSpitter plugin already installed, also copy the FireSpitter folder. If Kerbal Space Program is running, restart the program.

Description:
------------
This parts pack contains engines, tanks, and other part categories in three sizes that do not exist in stock KSP, namely 5m, 7.5m, and 10m. Parts are color-coded according to the universal electronic color code (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code), simply because the author is an old RDAF radar technician. Hence, size4 (5m) is yellow, size5 (7.5m) is green, and size6 (10m) is blue.

Engines are kept at reasonable thrust figures and are thus not overpowered compared to the thrust/size curve of stock parts. The same goes for reaction wheels. Big spaceships are going to be sluggish, as one would expect.
